 <h3>The man who knows infinity</h3>
   <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was a mathematician born and raised in Madras, India. He grew up impoverished, and didn’t have access to a traditional education, but he was gifted in mathematics. He was accepted into university twice, but both times flunked out because of his inability to focus on anything other than math. He had an arranged marriage but couldn’t provide for his wife. He sent his work off to mathematicians in England, where famous professor G. H. Hardy decided to take a chance on Ramanujan and brought him to Trinity College to work with him. That decision changed the trajectory of each of their lives as well as the field of mathematics.</p>
